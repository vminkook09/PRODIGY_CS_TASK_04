Simple Keylogger
Overview
This Python script serves as a basic keylogger designed to capture and log keystrokes from a user's keyboard. It operates silently in the background, recording all alphanumeric characters, special symbols, and function keys pressed by the user. The logged data is stored securely for analysis and monitoring purposes.

Features
Stealthy Operation: The keylogger runs discreetly without the user's awareness.

Comprehensive Logging: Captures all keystrokes and logs them along with timestamps for detailed analysis.

Secure Storage: Logs are stored securely in a designated file on the local system, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
